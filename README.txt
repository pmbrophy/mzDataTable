mzDataTable provides functions for importing mass spectrometry data formats (mzML/mzXML) into R as data.tables and disk.frames for in-memory and on-disk manipulation, respectively. This provides direct access to unprocessed data for exploration and experimentation using data.table syntax dplyr verbs supported by the data.table and disk.frame formats. Several domain specific functions have been developed for generating total ion chromatograms, extracting individual ions, and summing/gridding spectra to name a few. Additional tools are planned to be continually developed.
